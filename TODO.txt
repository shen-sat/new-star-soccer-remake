Main objective:
Re-make New Star Soccer for web

Gameplay basics:
- Ball controls
- Ball movement
- Generate obstacles (wall)
- Keeper

Ball controls:
I'd like it to feel as console-y as possible, so I'll avoid using mouse.
- direction: use left/right arrow keys for arrow clockwise- and anti-clockwise movement
- hit A to confiirm
- power: show close-up of ball. Move dot higher/lower
- hit A to confirm

Ball movement:
This should be as realistic as possible. Aids prediction. Sense of fairness.
- straight line
- if ball hit below midline, it will leave ground
- if ball hits ground it can bounce
- ball will eventually come to a stop
